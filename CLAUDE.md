# IBD Imaging Digest

Automated daily digest of new IBD imaging papers, ranked by semantic relevance to my work, delivered to my Obsidian vault, with a feedback loop that sharpens the ranker over time.

## Environment

- Python 3.11+
- 8GB RAM laptop, regional network constraints (proxy may be needed for some endpoints; set HTTPS_PROXY and HTTP_PROXY in shell before running)
- NCBI API key stored in .env, not committed
- Runs locally for development, GitHub Actions for production

## Code style

- No em dashes anywhere (code, comments, docs, commit messages)
- No emojis
- No decorative comments. Comment only when the "why" is non-obvious. Never restate what the code does.
- No verbose explanations between code blocks when responding. Show the change, brief rationale only if needed.
- Avoid typical AI-generated patterns: no excessive try/except wrapping, no defensive checks for impossible conditions, no "helper" functions that wrap one line, no over-abstraction.
- Plain, direct Python. Type hints throughout. Docstrings only on public functions, one line where possible.
- Prefer standard library over dependencies. Justify each third-party package.
- Use the logging module from the start. No print statements for logging.

## Project plan

### Goal
Daily Markdown digest of new IBD imaging papers in my Obsidian vault, with semantic ranking and a checkbox-driven feedback loop.

### Sources (v1)
- PubMed E-utilities API, using NCBI API key
- Radiology (Crossref API, ISSN 0033-8419)
- Radiology: Artificial Intelligence (Crossref API, ISSN 2638-6100)
- European Radiology (Crossref API, ISSN 1432-1084)
- Deduplication by DOI across all four sources

### Storage
- Single SQLite database
- `papers` table: DOI (primary key), title, authors, corresponding author, journal, date, abstract, source, embedding vector, similarity score, seen date, relevance status
- `corpus` table: relevance seed set with embeddings of papers marked relevant

### Ranking
- Embedding model: SPECTER2 (local, biomedical/scientific)
- Initial corpus: 20 to 50 papers selected manually from Zotero
- Score: max cosine similarity between candidate and corpus
- Tiers:
  - Must-read: score ≥ 0.75
  - Skim: 0.60 to 0.75
  - Archive: score < 0.60
- Thresholds adjustable after seeing real numbers

### Daily digest format
One Markdown note per day at `Inbox/Papers/YYYY-MM-DD.md` in the Obsidian vault.

Header: date, total new papers, count per tier.

For each paper in must-read and skim tiers:
- Title
- DOI as link
- Authors: first two plus corresponding author
- Journal and date
- Similarity score (numeric)
- Full abstract inside a collapsible Markdown callout
- Relevance checkbox: `- [ ] Relevant`

Archive tier: collapsed section, title + DOI link + authors only, no checkboxes.

Footer: source breakdown (papers per source, duplicates merged).

Empty days: note still generated, says "no new papers today, pipeline ran successfully."

### Feedback loop
- User ticks `- [x] Relevant` on papers in the digest
- Weekly job scans past week's digest notes for checked boxes
- Extracts those DOIs, pulls embeddings, adds to corpus table
- Ranker sharpens over time

### Infrastructure
- Python project in a GitHub repo
- GitHub Actions runs the fetcher daily on a cron schedule
- Daily digest committed to the repo
- Repo syncs to Obsidian vault via git

## Build order

- [ ] Step 1: Source layer (PubMed + Crossref + Springer RSS fetchers, dedup by DOI, write to SQLite)
- [ ] Step 2: Digest writer (Markdown output from SQLite, no ranking yet)
- [ ] Step 3: Embedding layer (SPECTER2, corpus from Zotero selection, scoring and tiering)
- [ ] Step 4: Obsidian integration (file paths, callouts, checkbox convention)
- [ ] Step 5: GitHub Actions scheduling and git sync
- [ ] Step 6: Feedback loop (weekly job parses checkboxes, updates corpus)

Scope includes adult and pediatric IBD imaging, treatment response and monitoring, plus high-level IBD reviews and guidelines (consensus papers, position statements, practice guidelines).

## Deferred (not in v1)

- LLM-generated abstract summaries
- Citation counts and altmetrics
- Author override filters (always surface specific authors regardless of score)
- Europe PMC, bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv sources
- Telegram or email notification for top-tier hits

## Open items

- Validate PubMed query against pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, check 30-day result count and quality
- Select 20 to 50 seed papers from Zotero for the initial corpus
- Decide Obsidian vault path: is the repo itself the vault, or does it sync into a separate vault?
